            description: "Monkey D. Luffy is the protagonist in One Piece and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He ate the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit that changed his body to rubber. His dream is to find the legendary One Piece and become Pirate King. He has made quite a name for himself around the world and has a bounty on his head to match - 1,500,000,000 Berries. Despite his naive attitude, he is an amazing leader who the Straw Hats follow with pride."
